# hoshidicts-rs

Safe Rust bindings for [hoshidicts](https://github.com/Manhhao/hoshidicts), a
Yomitan-dictionary import and lookup engine.

## Building

The C++ engine is a submodule and needs a C++23 toolchain (GCC 14+, Clang 17+,
or MSVC 2022). Check it out recursively:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
cargo build
```

On Linux, `build.rs` links the C++ standard library; point Cargo's linker at the
same C++ compiler used to build the engine (for example `g++-14`) so the
libstdc++ versions match.

## Usage

```rust
use hoshidicts::{Deinflector, LookupFrequencyOrder, LookupOptions, OwnedLookup, Query};

let mut query = Query::new();
query.add_term_dict("jitendex")?;
query.add_freq_dict("BCCWJ")?;

let lookup = OwnedLookup::new(query, Deinflector::new());

let options = LookupOptions {
    frequency_dictionary: Some("BCCWJ"),
    frequency_order: LookupFrequencyOrder::Ascending,
    primary_reading: None,
};
let results = lookup.run_with_options("蜂が好きです", 32, 16, &options)?;
for result in results.results() {
    println!("{}", result.term().expression());
}
```

`run` keeps its default-options behavior; `run_with_options` adds the
frequency-ordering and primary-reading controls.

## Threading

`Query`, `Deinflector`, `Lookup`, and `OwnedLookup` are `Send` but not `Sync`:
an owner may move to another thread, but concurrent calls must be serialized by
the caller. Result views borrow their owner and must be consumed before it is
dropped or moved.

## License

GPL-3.0-or-later, matching the engine.
